Simple rl.

- Turn based, grid-based. Character-based display.
@ - player.
a-zA-Z - monsters.
. - floor, # - walls.
!@$%^&*() - items.
- Single command set and command mode.
hjklyubn - movement.
. - wait.
> - go further to dungeon.
w - wield/unwield/grop/grab (exchange item in the slot with item on the tile).

map: WxH (80x24), one line for stats (hp, item stats, level etc).
Only one item and one monster (PC included) could occupy a tile.

One player character. Some monsters, some items.

Player could wield only one item. It serves as armor, weapon or whatever at once. Item has different stats that must be identified for proper usage.

All unkilled monsters from current level will result in addition of that exact amount of monster to usual one for the next level.

If there is monster, then movement will result in hitting it and (if monster'll drop dead) in movement to target tile.

Generation of the map: generate walls around the arena. Generate columns, halls and whatever. Use random walls and floors. Place > on the floor. Drop items all around the floor. Place player.

Sprite of items generates from it's stats: weapons are (, armor are ] and so on. Mapping of sprites/stats differs for each new game, not level.
So the monsters do.

- Non-trivial world and interactions.
- Freedom of choice.

- Plenty of content.
- High difficulty.
